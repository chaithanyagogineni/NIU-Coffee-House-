# NIU-Coffee-House-
This is academic project for my database class in masters.We have developed a website for the Coffee House which holds music nights.This is very user friendly.We developed user interface which helps the users to register for the music nights by communicating  with the system.
we also developed the admin module who can view the participant information on a particulat day or week or month.
we used HTML and JAVASCRIPT for front end scripting.We used MYSQL database to store data and used PHP to connect to the database.
